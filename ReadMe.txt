This repo is a where I store my CCTDE (cross-correlation time-delay estimation code).
This is the version that I personally use and contains the code which I used to generate the results in my velocimetry testing paper [in internal review]

In this branch, the code was developed with Python 3.7.1. Compatibility with other versions was not tested.

This repo is owned by Yorick W. Enters at the Culham Centre for Fusion Energy and the University of York
